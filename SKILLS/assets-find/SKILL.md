  "maxResults": 0
}'
```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash

}'
```

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `filter` | `string` | No | The filter string can contain search data. Could be empty. Name: Filter assets by their filename (without extension). Words separated by whitespace are treated as separate name searches. Labels (l:): Assets can have labels attached to them. Use 'l:' before each label. Types (t:): Find assets based on explicitly identified types. Use 't:' keyword. Available types: AnimationClip, AudioClip, AudioMixer, ComputeShader, Font, GUISkin, Material, Mesh, Model, PhysicMaterial, Prefab, Scene, Script, Shader, Sprite, Texture, VideoClip, VisualEffectAsset, VisualEffectSubgraph. AssetBundles (b:): Find assets which are part of an Asset bundle. Area (a:): Find assets in a specific area. Valid values are 'all', 'assets', and 'packages'. Globbing (glob:): Use globbing to match specific rules. Note: Searching is case insensitive. |
| `searchInFolders` | `any` | No | The folders where the search will start. If null, the search will be performed in all folders. |
| `maxResults` | `integer` | No | Maximum number of assets to return. If the number of found assets exceeds this limit, the result will be truncated. |
